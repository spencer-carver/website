This repository houses the code running my personal website at https://spencer.carvers.info. I plan to use it to showcase my prefered coding styles, and also to keep learning about the latest JS and Front-End development trends.

## About
### Code
This codebase began with the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter. It uses [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot) to save a first-render to the static files hosted in s3 to approximate a server-rendered page.
